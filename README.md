How to use:
- All needed datasets are in the project folder and synchronized.
- by running app.py a local flask server is set up and the IP is provided via the console
- in app.py "is_scattermapbox" have to be set to true if large datasets have to be processed


Open to do for further development:

- Data preprocessing need to be done in batches and on GPU
- Database / numba/padata
- New framework for the high amount of data is needed
- Plot wind data as an average with range-band
- In general wind data can be seen as a separate sub-project
- At least clod data and rain/snow need to be added
