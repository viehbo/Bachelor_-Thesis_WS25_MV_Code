\chapter{Use Case}

\section{Hypothesis}

Wind speed and direction changed over the years, to a stronger wind from south. This significantly influences the glacier melt. \\

This hypothesis is based on the assumption that due to general higher temperatures, the atmospheric pressure over the Mediterranean Sea increases on average, compared to the Northern Alps region. And as a result, more south Foehn days are seen over the main ridge, which causes temporarily high temperatures in affected areas.
