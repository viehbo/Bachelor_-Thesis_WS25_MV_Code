\chapter*{Abstract}

Data selection is one of the most important parts in every ML (Machine Learning) Task. In case of weather data, one faces a huge variety of different values with often high density. Clearly much more data than consumer hardware can process. 
Meteorologically, glaciers can be seen as a scale of climate change. By finding the most influential factors, the glacier changes might be much better predictable. Even more, our water supply in the Alps region could be better foreseen, caused by global heating. \\
In this project, one can discover ERA5 weather data by interacting with it. The conept is, to give a maximum of felxibility by keeping the interface intuitive. This gives deep insight of the data and therefore the basis, if and for what they can bes used. This is crucial for an successful ML project, safes a lot of time on model selection. Due to that, such tasks became more cost efficient and environmental friendly.
