\chapter{conclusion}

The very first idea to visually compare glacier data and meteorological data in some kind of plot, does work just partly.
One reason for that is the different nature of glacier observations and reanalyzed ERA5 data. Even reference glaciers are measured/claculated there changes once a year. Few years ago, not even that.

During the developent process, it turns out, this tool is surpringsingly well suited to get deep insights into meteorological data. So one can precisely decide, if a dataset is suitable for some task. And if yes, which resolution in time and which area is necessary.
