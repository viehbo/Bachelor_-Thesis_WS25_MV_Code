For temperature data and even more for wind data from ERA5, this tools can provide very useful insights. The low computational effort combined with the easy to use interface makes it absolute useful.



\section{Limitations}

\paragraph{Variables from ERA5}
Given that ERA5-Land consists of 49 variables, the implemented two variables can only represent a starting point.

\paragraph{WGMS data}
For the glaciers, only mass balance is considered. Including additional parameters, such as glacier area, could provide further insights. However, this would require a deeper understanding of glacier-specific data structures in order to ensure comparability.





\section{future work}

More variables like \textit{Snowfall} and \textit{Snow density}
